# 🧠 Observation & Evaluation Logs  
**Project:** Aristo — Dual Database RAG System (Postgres + Qdrant)  
**Folder Purpose:**  
This folder is dedicated to maintaining evolving logs, evaluations, and reflections on how the system performs at various stages of development.  
Each observation aims to capture **insights, breaking points, strengths, weaknesses, and forward steps**.  

The purpose is not static documentation, but **continuous discovery** — a running notebook that grows with the product.  

## 📘 About This Folder

- **Goal:** To track how the pipeline behaves under different conditions, configurations, and updates.  
- **Nature:** Exploratory and adaptive — insights may contradict previous ones as the system evolves.  
- **Usage:**  
  - Add one `.md` file per experiment, iteration, or testing phase.  
  - Follow (loosely) the Observation Template provided below.  
  - Use freeform notes where needed — structure should help thinking, not restrict it.  

## 🧩 Components Typically Evaluated

1. **Document Parsing & Chunking** — e.g., Docling behavior, chunk size, overlap, content loss.  
2. **Embedding Generation** — quality, speed, model choice, consistency across datasets.  
3. **Vector Database (Qdrant)** — indexing speed, retrieval accuracy, filtering efficiency.  
4. **Relational Database (Postgres)** — query reliability, hybrid search joins, latency.  
5. **RAG Pipeline** — end-to-end latency, context accuracy, response coherence.  
6. **Agent Behavior (if applicable)** — reasoning quality, API/tool interaction, fallback handling.  

## 🧭 Observation Log Template

Each observation file should be titled like:  
`YYYY-MM-DD_<Short-Title>.md`  
(e.g., `2025-10-13_initial-qdrant-performance.md`)

### 🧩 1. Context
- **Date:**  
- **Stage / Component Tested:**  
- **Objective:** (what were you trying to test, prove, or understand?)  
- **Environment:** (hardware, software versions, dataset used, configs)

### ⚙️ 2. Process
- **Steps Taken:**  
  (brief list or narrative of what was done)  
- **Tools / Parameters Used:**  
  (models, DB versions, chunk sizes, hyperparameters, etc.)

### 📊 3. Observations
- **Performance:**  
  - Response times / Latency:  
  - Accuracy / Relevance (qualitative + quantitative):  
- **System Behavior:**  
  (did something break, behave unexpectedly, slow down, etc.)  
- **Strengths Observed:**  
  -  () 
- **Weaknesses / Bottlenecks:**  
  -  ()

### 🧩 4. Analysis
- **Interpretation:**  
  What does this tell you about the system or a specific component?  
- **Hypotheses:**  
  What could explain the observed behavior?  
- **Comparisons:**  
  (if relevant) how does this compare to a previous setup or baseline?

### 🚧 5. Breaking Points
- **Where did the system fail or degrade?**  
- **What conditions triggered it?**  
- **Logs / Metrics (if any):**  

### 💡 6. Insights & Next Steps
- **Key Takeaways:**  
  -  ()
- **Ideas for Improvement / Next Tests:**  
  -  ()
- **Questions Raised:**  
  -  ()

### 🗒️ 7. Notes / Misc
Any freeform notes, emotional reactions (“felt slow”, “surprisingly good”), sketches, or references.

## 🧩 Future Evolution
This structure can (and should) evolve with the system.  
As the Aristo pipeline matures, additional sections such as **Evaluation Metrics**, **Agent Reasoning Logs**, or **User Feedback Analysis** may be added.
