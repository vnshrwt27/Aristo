# Project Summary: Aristo

**Aristo** is an advanced *agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)* system designed to enhance research and collaborative report creation through intelligent data qualification, transparent reasoning, and auditability. Unlike traditional RAG implementations, Aristo employs a **dual-database architecture**—one for raw data and another for validated, contextually enriched knowledge—enabling more accurate, traceable, and adaptive information retrieval.

Users can upload diverse data sources, which Aristo then **qualifies using LLM-based analysis** to assess reliability, extract insights, and provide context-aware assistance for report writing or research synthesis. Each output is accompanied by a detailed **audit trail**, showing data provenance, benchmarks, and confidence metrics to ensure factual integrity and explainability.

A key innovation in Aristo is its **modular source control system**, allowing users to *toggle individual data sources on or off* without breaking the knowledge chain. This ensures that when a dataset or document is deemed unreliable or outdated, it can be instantly excluded from the reasoning process—preserving both transparency and adaptability.

By combining **collaborative editing tools**, **dynamic data governance**, and **AI-augmented reasoning**, Aristo aims to redefine how researchers and analysts interact with knowledge—offering a system that is not only powerful and accurate, but also verifiable, flexible, and human-aligned.
